\title{Global Fossil Fuel Consumption}
\format{
A data frame with 231 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
  \item{entity}{Character, name of the country or region (currently "World")}
  \item{code}{Character, country/region code (OWID_WRL for World)}
  \item{year}{Numeric, year of observation (1800-present)}
  \item{fuel}{Ordered factor with 3 levels: Oil, Gas, Coal.
    Levels are ordered for logical stacking in plots}
  \item{consumption}{Numeric, primary energy consumption in terawatt-hours (TWh).
    All values are positive, making this dataset ideal for area plots}

\description{
Primary energy consumption from fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) measured
in terawatt-hours (TWh). Data covers global consumption from 1800 to recent years.
}
\details{
This dataset tracks the historical consumption of fossil fuels globally,
showing the dramatic increase in energy use since the Industrial Revolution.
The data is particularly useful for visualizing energy transitions and the
relative importance of different fossil fuels over time.

**Key features:**
\itemize{
  \item All consumption values are positive (no negative values)
  \item Fuel types are ordered factors for better plot aesthetics
  \item Covers over 200 years of energy history
  \item Ideal for demonstrating area plots and stacked visualizations
}

The fuel factor is ordered as Oil > Gas > Coal, which creates an intuitive
visual hierarchy when creating stacked area charts.
