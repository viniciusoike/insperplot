```{r}
library(insperplot)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

# General points

- The insper_ functions could have a `scale_name` (or something similar) that allows the user to change the name of the scale/legend


```{r}
insper_scatterplot(mtcars, x = mpg, y = wt, color = factor(cyl))

# currently, user needs to use guides() or labs() to change the name
insper_scatterplot(mtcars, x = mpg, y = wt, color = factor(cyl)) +
    guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Cylinders"))

insper_scatterplot(mtcars, x = mpg, y = wt, color = factor(cyl)) +
    guides(fill = "Cylinders")
```

OBS: this will be a bit tricky for the `insper_scatterplot` function, since the user can set both `color` and `fill` to the same variable. In this case, the legend will show both the color and fill scales.

- All examples are wrapped with "\dontrun{}" to avoid running them. We can remove this now. This also likely means that some examples will break and will need to be updated.
