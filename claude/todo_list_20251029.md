# TODO List fo 2025-10-29

- Update script of data-raw/datasets.R with new OWID dataset
- Update R/data.R with new OWID dataset
- Cleanup data-raw (create_colors_and_palettes.R is the newer version of create_palettes.R)

KeM## Examples

- Examples should run! (remove dontrun{} from all examples).
- Many examples are likely to break and need to be updated.
- Let's try to make examples consistent and short.
- Some examples have bad practices like using facet_wrap(~variable) instead of facet_wrap(vars(variable)). Let's make sure that examples also follow claude/coding_guidelines.md
- If possible, use data from the package in examples.
- We should avoid complex examples that require loading any other package than ggplot2. (i.e. don't make an example that requires t
idyr).

## Function inconsistency
- setup_insper_fonts() and check_insper_fonts() can return inconsistent results for the user. If the user has, for example, Inter, Georgia, and EB Garamond installed, then check_insper_fonts() will notify that Playfair Display is missing, but setup_insper_fonts() returns "Excellent! Your setup is optimal.".

## insper_barplot
- This function uses `scales::comma()` as default which is incorrect. We assume users are Brazilian and we should use `scales::label_number(big.mark = ".", decimal.mark = ",")` or something equivalent to this. It's also unclear how the user can change this parameter.

## insper_scatterplot
- This function almost always returns a warning about the use of `fill` when the user doesn't specify a value for `fill`. Let's silently suppress this warning.

## insper_area
- The example for this function is not good. The underlying `geom_area()` function is known to not perform well when the data mixes positve and negative values.
- Our example should use a dataset with only positive values.
- I suggest using the fossil_fuels internal dataset for this example.

## Internal package organization

- The R/plots.R file has grown too big. Let's split it into multiple files. This should be easy since each `insper_*` function is a separate entity.

## vignette issue
- The `getting-started.Rmd` vignette is not rendering correctly. There seems to be some font related issue. Let's try to fix this.
- The `plotting-functions.Rmd` vignette is incomplete at the moment. Is there a way to hide it?

# Overall

This is our TODO list for this day. Completing all tasks will mark v1.3.1
